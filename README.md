# Woodland Sprint

Basic C# Endless Runner for my 3rd Year Games Programming Module. Developed in Unity.

Game is based around on avoiding logs while collecting leaves, similar to others in the Endless Runner genre. Operates using a health system rather than flat out immediately dying when encountering an obstacle.
